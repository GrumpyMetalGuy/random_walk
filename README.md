Random Walk is a secure web application that helps users discover and track interesting places to visit around their location through randomly generated walking routes. Using OpenStreetMap data, it provides a curated list of places like parks, tourist attractions, towns, and cities, with individual user accounts and role-based access control.

## Features

### 🔐 **Authentication & User Management**
  - **Secure user accounts** with username/password authentication
  - **Role-based access control**: Admin and User roles
  - **First-run setup** with admin account creation
  - **JWT token authentication** with 30-day expiration and remember me option
  - **Password security** with Argon2id hashing and 20-character minimum requirement
  - **User management** for admins to create and manage user accounts

### 🗺️ **Place Discovery & Management**
  - Search for places within customizable distances (5-40 miles)
  - Filter by place types (parks, tourist attractions, towns, cities, playgrounds)
  - Get random place suggestions
  - International location support with country-specific filtering
  - Track places with three states: Available, Planning to Visit, and Visited
  - Plan and unplan visits
  - Mark places as visited/unvisited
  - **Shared place visits** between all users

### 🏠 **Smart Location Handling**
  - Automatic country detection from home address
  - OpenStreetMap geocoding integration
  - Support for What3Words location format
  - Distance-based and bounding box search

### 👨‍💼 **Admin Features**
  - **Data overview dashboard** with user, place, and setting statistics
  - **User management** with ability to create new users
  - **Data export** (JSON format) for GDPR compliance
  - **Data deletion** capabilities
  - **System settings** management

## Quick Start

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Docker and Docker Compose (or Node.js 18+ for local development)
   - Git
   - Basic terminal knowledge

2. **Installation**
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd random-walk

   # Create environment file
   cat > .env << EOL
   NODE_ENV=production
   DATABASE_URL=file:/app/data/randomwalk.db
   PORT=4000
   JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
   EOL

   # Start the application
   docker-compose up
   ```

   **✨ Database Auto-Setup**: The application will automatically:
   - Create the database file if it doesn't exist
   - Run all necessary migrations
   - Seed initial data
   - No manual database setup required!

3. **Access the application**:
   - **Full Application**: http://localhost:4000
   - **Health Check**: http://localhost:4000/health
   - **API Endpoints**: http://localhost:4000/api/*

4. **First-Run Setup**:
   On your first visit, you'll see a setup screen to create the initial admin account. The database initialization happens automatically - just create your admin user and start using the app!

### Local Development (without Docker)

```

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express, TypeScript
- **Database**: SQLite with Prisma ORM v6.9.0
- **Authentication**: JWT with Argon2id password hashing
- **Testing**: Vitest (frontend) and Jest (backend) with React Testing Library
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Build System**: Vite (frontend), TypeScript compiler (backend)

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run frontend tests
npm run test:frontend

# Run backend tests
npm run test:backend
```

### Development Mode
```bash
# Start development server (builds frontend first, then starts backend)
npm run dev

# Or if frontend is already built, watch-only mode
npm run dev:watch

# Or start directly from backend (requires frontend to be pre-built)
cd backend && npm run dev
```

### Database Management
```bash
# View database in Prisma Studio
cd backend && npx prisma studio

# Reset database (development only)
cd backend && npx prisma migrate reset

# Create new migration
cd backend && npx prisma migrate dev --name your-migration-name
```

## User Roles & Permissions
